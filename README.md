# Task 1: Let’s get functional, functional.

We want to write calculations using functions and get the results.

**Here are some examples:**

```ruby
six(times(five)) # must return 30
one(plus(nine)) # must return 10
six(minus(three)) # must return 3
eight(divided_by(two)) # must return 4
```

## Requirements

* There must be a function for each number from 0 (“zero”) to 9 (“nine”)
* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: `plus`, `minus`, `times`, `divided_by`
* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand

## Guidelines

* Use Git and commit as often as you think is necessary to properly tell your story
* Write tests using RSpec proving that your solution works (TDD strongly encouraged)
* Use whatever tools you’d like (gems, patterns, etc)
* Engineer your solution as if there’s a high chance it will be re-used
* Keep lines wrapped at 120 characters
* Enjoy this challenge!

## What we're looking for

* Coding style (tidyness &amp; legibility)
* Abstractions
* Testing practices
* Commit journey

## How to get started & submit

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a new branch to work from
3. Do your thing
4. When you're done, push your branch and create a PR for the team to review
